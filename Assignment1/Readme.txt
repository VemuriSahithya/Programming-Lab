Assignment 1

Run the java programs by using the following commands for the respective questions:

Q1. Sock Matching Robot

$javac Main1.java
$java Main1

After running the above commands give two inputs in the terminal one for number of socks and the other for specifying number of threads.
For example give the input as 1 2 where 1 implies number of socks and 2 is the number of threads
Then the corresponding output will be displayed in the terminal.

Q2. Data Modification in Distributed System

$javac Main2.java
$java Main2

After running the above commands options will be displayed in the terminal and then give the input accordingly.
The input should be given by observing the records in Stud_Info.txt.
The changes can be observed in the Stud_Info.txt, Sorted_Roll.txt and Sorted_Name.txt after execution.

Q3. Calculator For Differently Abled Persons

Part 1:

Main3_1 is for single digit input i.e. you can just select numbers 0-9 and can apply operations (*,+,-,/) on it.
For example you can do 1+2 but 11+2 cannot be done here. 

$javac Main3_1.java
$java Main3_1

After running the above commands a window will be displayed and based on the instructions displayed there you can do calcuations.
If you will try doing division by zero then a message will be displayed on the textbox showing invalid input.
If you want to exit the window then you can either press 'Esc' or close the window manually.

Part 2:
Main3_2 is for multiple digits number calculations. Now you can calculate for numbers having any number of digits.

$javac Main3_2.java
$java Main3_2

After running the above commands a window will be displayed and based on the instructions displayed there you can do calcuations.
If you will try doing division by zero then a message will be displayed on the textbox showing invalid input.
If you want to exit the window then you can either press 'Esc' or close the window manually.
